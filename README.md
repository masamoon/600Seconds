## Concept

600 Seconds is a rogue-lite side scroller where the objective is to get 100.000$ worth of gems to pay off the Space Mafia which is in charge of Earth's protection. On the Normal mode you have 10 minutes (600 seconds) to travel through different *Moons* in order to get a *shot* at saving the Earth (hehe get it?), or you could say that acquiring 100.000$ in 10 minutes is a *Moonshot*. Ok I'll stop.

If you're feeling spicy, try the Hard mode where the time limit is reduced to 3 minutes. Be mindful of your fuel level, don't get hit by enemies and use bombs strategically.
